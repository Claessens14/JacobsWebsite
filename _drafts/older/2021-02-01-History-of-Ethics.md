Philosophy of ones of the subjects that are easy to ignore and arrogant people see as pointless. Once one takes more than 15 minutes to look into the questions of philosophy, one can begin to grasp the difficulty of the topics being discussed.

So here are some of the popular ethics theories in the world of philosophy. For those that don't know, ethics is reasoning system we use to create our moral. Morals are the application of ones ethical beliefs. Much like how in programming, an object is an implementation of class.

## Mill's Utilitarianism

An action is ethically correct if it produces the greatest benefit for the greatest number of people. The duration, intensity, equality, and time delay, of the benifits should be considered.

## Kant's Duty-Based Ethics

Each person has a duty to follow those courses of action that would be acceptable as universal principle for everyone to follow. Human life should be respected, and people should not be used as a means to achieve some other goal.

## Locke's Rights-Based Ethics

All individuals are free and equal, and each has a right to life, health , liberty possesions, and the products of his or her labour.

## Aristotle's Virtue-based Ethics

Happiness is achieved by developing virtues, or qualities of character, through deduction and reason. An act is good if it is in accordance with reason. This usually means a course of action that is the golden mean between extremes of excess and deficiency.

## My thoughts

When you read Mill's virtue ethics I know what your thinking...

This is the obvious case in which Mill's idea may be wrong

### FYI

Thonas was a perversion of the Jesus Christ in what the Russo Brothers call "sociopath with a messiah complex". That's why Thanos speaks in absolutes calling himself 'I am' and other people 'his children', in which he 'saves' them, then proceeds to rest on completion of his work in a garden. Sound familiar?

[TheWrap](https://www.thewrap.com/infinity-war-directors-explain-thanos-double-universe-resources/)

> While talking about the “Infinity War” scene on Knowhere, the filmmakers went through some of the underlying drives and emotions in Thanos, specifically as relates to Gamora, his adopted daughter. They noted that Thanos is a **“sociopath with a messiah complex,”** and also said the events on Titan are part of Thanos’ reasoning, but his character flaws are what really drive him.

### FYI FYI

It may not too be much of pervsion as Thanos 'saved' half the people, to say that Jesus will save that many is questionable, especially in todays world.
