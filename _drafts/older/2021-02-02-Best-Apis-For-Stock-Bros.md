As you collect some money your probably thinking about mutual funds, stocks, bonds, indexes and how to do this entire money game works. As many of you already know, banks pay you basically nothing in interest and if you put you money into a mutual fund, you will have a cardioc arrest by the time

- 30 year compound.. I should start a mutual fund. jeez

But with your wall street bets stock knowledge and some intermediate programming skills, is there anyway to combine these. Well yes ofc, I got you. 

Here are the 2 big guys. Note you need to make an account, some data is free, some is not. If you combine them both together than maybe you can basically get alot fo free stock data. I have used there http requests, however they also have SDK's that are worth checking out, if i were to start a new project today i would.

Iex Cloud

Finnhub

Economics data
- note the images are public link, that you can can program for a request

vantage api
I don't know how they collect there data, but supposedly it is controversial. I am too busy to look into. If i were to 'bad business practices' in regards to stock, i sure wouldn't start with a public api lol.
