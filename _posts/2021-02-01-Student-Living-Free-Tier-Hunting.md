Students are always looking for those sweet deals. Save the money, buy crypto, collect tendies, repeat. However, in this transition faze of our lives from know-nothing freshmen to master algo crypto investors who makes beats on the weekend. You must be wondering what sort of servers do you have available to me as an broke student. Well here you go.

First let’s go with the options that don't need the credit card, because that’s annoying, and easy to accidentally run those up with these services when you are just learning. What we are going be looking at is app services / engines. These great because they are easy to deploy, cheap, and do the job.

## Azure

Solid option, azure is one of the best all-around services out there, however this free tier doesn't allow you to run an app service without sleep mode, which is not cool. This means when a person who is interested in your work, may be hit with a 30 second wake up time upon calling your app. Ouch. Nevertheless App services are a really popular option, and recommend people using them.
However when you register with them with your school email, you can get free credits, which can pay for a good app service. No credit card needed. Just have to renew every year for more money.

However, Azure makes it really easy to debug / evaluate code running in app services, they got a lot of integration options which I like to see (GitHub actions, Azure DevOps, Travis). I have been experiencing some issues with their latest updates to it, however I am sure not everyone is having that.

## IBM Cloud

Big blue is stepping into the cloud world. And if you think they are late and irrelevant, put on a red hat and think again. They sell / manage many private servers for majors corporations and are well positioned to take advantage of the hybrid cloud model. They also got rid of those MBA CEOs and got in someone in who's actually tech man. Since this platform has less features, its less complex, thus easier to learn.

More importantly, they got the students covered. It's goes by the name [light tier](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/cloud-foundry#section-heading-2). The "app services / engine" is are cloud foundry apps, that when deployed has always running is an option. No credit card, no expiration, just email.

Biggest drawback is the they have few integration options as I am currently writing, and many employers are looking for AWS / Azure / GCP experience.

## GCP - Google Cloud Platform

No student offering. Well actually they have [free training](https://edu.google.com/programs/students/training-benefits/?modal_active=none). Nevertheless, they currently have a first 3 months you have access to $300 which is nice. I used it to spin up some windowsVMs. However, all that compute power is only temporary, because you’re not going be looking to rack up a bill that approaches 100$ a month when the trial is over.

## Amazon

I have limited experience with Amazon. But they got a good [free tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?nc2=h_ql_pr_ft&all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc) also for students.

## School Servers

Your faculty / school Dev groups may have server space for you to work with also for free. This is often a popular option for students looking to train Ai models.

If these free tiers don't work for you and you need to pay up. Do it. Or ask your parents for help maybe. However, don't let some pennies get in the way of getting things done. At the end of the day, people will evaluate you code on how it runs, less on how it runs, so getting it running is worth the cost.
