For me, I am always been interested in the team collaboration software. Anyone who has worked in a dev team understand the natural difficulties that arrive from coordinating people to make progress on a variety of tasks & goals. In the modern day, a team will heavily use a messaging app, source control, CI/CD pipeline, private repo, documentation wiki, tasks management boards, project documentation board for long term goals / plans.

I have worked at serval companies, each of them using a variety of solutions. And based off that I would say the most important things to a company is, does it offer a on premise solution, and how well does it integrate with other workflow apps. However, I have seen companies uninterested into integrated solutions to chat, repo, CI/CD, as they believed it can lead to "cloud dependence‚Äù and allows for them to easily select the best product for each domain. Which I would say is solid train of thought, however for me, I am a fan of integrated solutions, as so much time can be wasted in repeating information across different medians, and managing serval different apps, when a developer should be focused on writing code and google searching. Furthermore, I enjoy locally run applications instead of web browser run, it is a personal preference maybe, but something I consider. Digging through tabs to find the right task board is not as clean to going to a `cmd+tabbing` locally running applications.

I have compiled a list of the different collaboration options and added my two cents to some. I not going to a graph of the pricing model, because those are always changing. Note I am writing on March 6th, 2021

## Atlassian

[https://www.atlassian.com/](https://www.atlassian.com/)  
I have used Atlassian both on premises and off premises, in several work environments. I was very impressed with there cloud offering. While the on premise solution lagged behind significantly, maybe it was our system admin not updating quick enough though, I never found out. However when using the Atlassian latest version (cloud) it is a very nice experience. Jira, Conflunece, Bitbucket were integrated nicely, with Jira being very impressive in its ability to serve tasks boards. Can't go wrong with Atlassian.

## JetBrains Space

[https://www.jetbrains.com/space/](https://www.jetbrains.com/space/)  
I am personally a fan of JetBrains products, if it wasn't for VScode being so good I would use there IDE's more. They can be very productive. So, when the launch their collaboration tool, it looks rather impressive. Chat, project management, CI/CD. All looks rather nice. Still quite new though, no on prem offering yet also.

## Microsoft Azure DevOps & GitHub

[https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/)  
Microsoft is one of those companies that could providing tooling for development, but almost all business functions. The list is staggering, as to the risk of cloud capture. However, the products you can get are pretty solid. They may already be providing you, email(outlook), cloud back up (OneDrive), calendar, word processing, excel (companies love excel), LinkedIn for PR, workstation / server / database OS, and cloud provider (azure), programming language (C# DotNet, F#), IDE (Visual Studio or VScode), of course search engine "Bing". lol just kidding about that one. Nevertheless, I haven't even talked about their workflow management software for devs yet and the list is already staggering. Following the steps of Visual Studio Teams Services (VSTS) they created a solid offering Azure DevOps, it got off to a rocky start with this [HackerNews post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18983586).

However, they have continued from there, and people have been starting to notice. The potential for a product like this to fit into the Microsoft product portfolio for current and future customers is of notice. Furthermore, they also own GitHub now, which is such a big player in the online repo world, that when they release GitHub actions, they instantly became a major player in the CI/CD world. Furthermore, Microsoft also owns Teams, which is solid chat app, that has video, calendar, whiteboard, and streams (recording) integrated into 1 place. If you spend some time in Azure and Azure DevOps, you will notice that they are actively integrating these products together, to users can easily synchronize the workflow between services. Its a lot to take in, depending on what you want you will have to look at the fees, and watch out for cloud capture, nevertheless all rather impressive.

## GitLab

[https://about.gitlab.com/](https://about.gitlab.com/)  
GitLab primarily focuses on enterprise clients unlike GitHub, which also has a large community base. There repo/CI/CD software is feature rich, with an emphasis on security. They also have one of the most active and interesting corporate blogs in the industry. There YouTube channel even posts some of their informative internal discussions about the current status of the DevOps market. Solid option.

## Slack

The most well known messaging app on the market, many apps to integrate to.

## Mattermost

I have used this and enjoyed it, functions must like slack but is open source. Which means you can deploy it on your own servers, in you own vpn. Very Nice.

### Update

Over the years I have started to value security more and more, now I am the belief that collaboration software should be selfhosted! Despite what vendors would make you think, there security practices are often not 'top notch'.
